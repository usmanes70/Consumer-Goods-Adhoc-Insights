# CodeBasics Resume Project Challenge - Consumer Good Adhoc Insights

In this project, we have to provide the insights to management in consumer domain which is our top management.

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

We have 10 Adhoc requests to query and extract insights from them to present infront of the stake holders.

Tools which i have used for this purpose are:

1. Mysql
2. Microsoft Power BI
3. Microsoft Excel
4. Microsoft Power Point

I hope you like my work.
